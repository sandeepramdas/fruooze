INSTRUCTIONS: Add Your FRUOOZE Logo
========================================

Please save your FRUOOZE logo image to this directory (/public) with the filename: logo.png

The logo should be:
- In PNG format (with transparent background preferred)
- High resolution (at least 500px wide)
- The image you provided earlier with the orange slices forming the "OO" in FRUOOZE

Once you add the logo.png file here, it will automatically appear in:
1. Browser favicon/tab icon
2. Website header/navigation
3. Footer
4. Social media previews (Open Graph)

The website is already configured to use /logo.png from this directory.

Temporary: A fallback SVG favicon has been created (favicon.svg) for testing purposes.
